### Description: 

First, I will being with what the code does and then explain why I chose this project in particular out of any other Java project have I done. 
To begin with, this application simply prompts the user for how many students they would like to create and then stores those students in an array of Students called myStudents. The program would ask for relevant information about said students,
like full name, GPA, credit hours, and date of birth, along with all the necessary code required to validate proper input for each of these subjects, for instance, having a date of birth that was not only valid but that could account for leap years or account
for people that do not possess a middle name, etc., and then spit out all students in the myStudent array and the information that the user provided for each. I, along with four other students were tasked with writing this project, and I ended up writing almost
all of it. I wrote the classes for the DOB, almost all of the TestClass, a lot of the Student Class, and even a whole UML that was created on an Excel sheet.

Now, as might be completely obvious about this project, it's very basic, and even for how basic it
was, it can still be improved significantly, but ultimately, I chose this project because a lot of firsts for me occurred during its development: Mainly working with others on a Java project; my first experience with IO exceptions; we had to give a
presentation on the code we had written, explain aspects of the code here and there, such as where inheritance was occurring or where and what the constructor was, and we were also required to create a proper UML that was submitted along with the
project. As I have already stated, this project is very barebones, and even for what it is attempting to do, it is only doing the bare minimum to accomplish it. But I love looking back at this project because it really puts into perspective, at least for me, that
there is always room for improvement. I can say that, if only a little, I have in fact improved since last writing this project almost a year ago, and it's not just about quality but speed. Keep in mind that this was written by four people (earlier, I technically said
five, but one of the students refused to do any amount of work on the assignment). We were given around a month to write this, and while we technically did everything required for the given assignment, the end result for a project like this written by any
one of us today would be at the very least not close to a month.
